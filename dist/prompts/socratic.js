**Topic to Explore:**
${topic}

**Desired Depth:** ${layers} layers of questioning

**Purpose of Each Layer:**
- **Layer 1**: Clarify definitions, scope, and success criteria
  Example: "What exactly do we mean by 'success'?" "Who are the stakeholders?"
- **Layer 2**: Question assumptions and expose hidden constraints
  Example: "What are we assuming about the context?" "What constraints haven't been stated?"
- **Layer 3+**: Challenge evidence, test boundaries, explore alternatives
  Example: "What evidence would prove/disprove this?" "What happens at the extremes?"

**Deliberation Steps:**
1. **Generate Questions Per Layer**: For each layer 1 to ${layers}, create 3-5 probing questions
   - Start broad (definitions, scope)
   - Go deeper (assumptions, constraints)
   - Finish with evidence and validation
   
2. **Identify Assumptions**: List key assumptions exposed by the questioning
   Example: "We're assuming stakeholders agree on priorities" ✅
   Not: "There are assumptions" ❌

3. **Specify Evidence Needed**: What data or information would answer the questions?
   Example: "User survey on pain points" ✅
   Not: "More information" ❌

4. **Recommend Next Actions**: Concrete steps to address knowledge gaps
   Example: "Interview 5 users about their workflow" ✅
   Not: "Learn more" ❌
