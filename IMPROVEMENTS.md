# ReasonSuite Self-Improvement Summary

## 🔍 Analysis Process

ReasonSuite used its own reasoning tools to analyze and improve itself:

### Tools Used for Self-Analysis

1. **Socratic Inquiry** - Identified key weaknesses and improvement opportunities
2. **Abductive Reasoning** - Generated hypotheses about system issues
3. **Systems Thinking** - Mapped interdependencies and feedback loops
4. **Red/Blue Challenge** - Found vulnerabilities through adversarial testing
5. **Dialectic Analysis** - Debated improvement strategies
6. **Divergent Thinking** - Generated solution ideas
7. **Scientific Method** - Designed validation plan
8. **Razor Screening** - Validated which improvements to prioritize

## 🚀 Latest Iteration: Error Handling Improvements (2025-09-30)

### Issue Identified

ReasonSuite MCP tools were returning raw Zod validation errors instead of structured JSON fallbacks when required fields were missing or malformed. This caused MCP client failures and poor user experience.

**Root Cause:** Tools used `InputSchema.parse()` which throws on validation failure, bypassing the fallback mechanism.

### Tools Used for Self-Diagnosis

1. **reasoning.selector** - Identified Socratic inquiry as primary diagnostic mode
2. **reasoning.router.plan** - Created multi-step diagnostic plan
3. **socratic.inquire** - Clarified scope and success criteria
4. **abductive.hypothesize** - Generated 4 hypotheses about error causes
5. **razors.apply** - Screened hypotheses using MDL, Popper, and Bayesian razors
6. **reasoning.self_explain** - Synthesized findings and validated fix strategy

### Fix Applied

Updated all affected tools to use `InputSchema.safeParse()` with graceful error handling:

- ✅ `abductive.hypothesize` - Now returns structured error on invalid input
- ✅ `systems.map` - Now returns structured error on invalid input  
- ✅ `redblue.challenge` - Now returns structured error on invalid input
- ✅ `constraint.solve` - Now returns structured error on invalid input

**Pattern Applied:**

```typescript
// Before (throws error):
const validatedArgs = InputSchema.parse(rawArgs);

// After (graceful handling):
const parsed = InputSchema.safeParse(rawArgs);
if (!parsed.success) {
    return jsonResult({ error: "Invalid arguments for tool.name", issues: parsed.error.issues });
}
```

### Impact

- ✅ All MCP tool responses now return valid JSON even on validation errors
- ✅ Clients receive actionable error messages with field-level diagnostics
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms activate correctly when LLM sampling fails
- ✅ Consistent error handling across all reasoning tools

## 🎯 Latest Iteration: Improved Tool Usage Instructions (2025-09-30)

### Issue Identified

AI models (including Cursor AI) were not consistently recognizing when to use ReasonSuite tools, often attempting freehand reasoning instead of invoking appropriate tools.

**Root Cause:** Instructions focused on output format rather than clear trigger patterns and decision rules for tool selection.

### Tools Used for Self-Diagnosis

1. **reasoning.selector** - Identified the prompt improvement task (though incorrectly suggested exec)
2. **socratic.inquire** - Attempted to clarify requirements (returned fallback)
3. Code inspection and manual analysis of existing rules

### Improvements Applied

#### 1. Updated `.cursor/rules/01-mcp-usage.mdc`

**New Features:**

- ✅ Clear decision tree at the top (multi-step? uncertain? pattern match?)
- ✅ Comprehensive trigger pattern table mapping user requests to tools
- ✅ Mandatory tool usage rules with examples
- ✅ Common mistakes section with wrong vs. correct examples
- ✅ Specific guidance for self-improvement tasks
- ✅ Removed confusing output format requirements (those were for tools, not AI using tools)

**Key Addition - Trigger Pattern Table:**

```
| Pattern in User Request | Required Tool | Example Triggers |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Diagnose, debug, "why?", root cause | abductive.hypothesize | "Why is X failing?" |
| Plan, strategy, roadmap, multi-step | reasoning.router.plan | "How should I approach X?" |
| Unclear scope, ambiguous requirements | socratic.inquire | "Make this better" |
... (full table in file)
```

#### 2. Updated `src/resources/master-prompt.md`

**New Features:**

- ✅ Quick start decision tree at the top
- ✅ Tool selection matrix with trigger words and pairing requirements
- ✅ Critical rules section (MUST use X after Y)
- ✅ Anti-pattern warnings with ❌ examples
- ✅ Clearer focus on WHEN to use tools vs HOW they work

**Pattern Improvements:**

```markdown
**Critical Rules:**
1. If task needs 3+ steps → MUST use reasoning.router.plan first
2. After abductive.hypothesize → MUST call razors.apply
3. For ANY calculation → MUST use exec.run (never compute manually)
... (full list in file)
```

### Impact

**Expected Improvements:**

- ✅ AI will recognize more situations where tools should be used
- ✅ Reduced freehand reasoning when tools are available
- ✅ Better tool chaining (e.g., always using razors after abductive)
- ✅ More proactive use of reasoning.selector when uncertain
- ✅ Consistent use of reasoning.router.plan for multi-step tasks

**Measurable Changes:**

- Decision tree prominently placed at top of both documents
- 13 tool trigger patterns clearly documented with examples
- 6 critical "MUST" rules for tool usage
- Common mistakes section with wrong ❌ vs. correct ✅ examples
- Removed confusing JSON output format requirements

### Self-Improvement Process

This iteration demonstrates ReasonSuite improving its own usability:

1. Identified problem through usage observation
2. Used own tools (selector, socratic) to analyze issue
3. Applied fix by rewriting instructions for clarity
4. Documented the meta-improvement process

**Next Steps for Validation:**

- Monitor whether AI consistently uses tools after these changes
- Collect examples of improved vs. missed tool usage
- Consider adding automated tests for tool selection logic

## ✅ Key Findings (Original Analysis)

### High Priority Issues Identified

1. **Generic Prompts** - Prompts lacked context, examples, and specific guidance
2. **Vague Error Messages** - Errors like "Invalid JSON" didn't help users fix issues
3. **Missing Examples** - No good/bad examples in prompts to guide LLMs
4. **Inconsistent Validation** - Error handling varied across tools

### Leverage Points (Highest Impact)

- **Prompt Quality** → Directly affects LLM utilization and output quality
- **Error Clarity** → Improves user success rate and reduces friction
- **Input Validation** → Prevents common mistakes early

## 🔧 Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Constraint Solver Prompt

**Before:**

```
You are a constraint reasoning assistant backed by Z3.
Constraint specification (JSON): ${model_json}
Deliberation steps: ...
```

**After:**

```
You are a constraint reasoning assistant backed by Z3. Your goal is to solve or optimize constraint satisfaction problems using SMT logic.

**Expected Input Format:**
{
  "variables": [{"name": "x", "type": "Int|Real|Bool"}],
  "constraints": ["(>= x 0)", "(<= x 10)"],
  "optimize": {"objective": "x", "sense": "max|min"}
}

**Common Constraint Patterns:**
- Comparisons: "(>= x 0)", "(<= x 10)", "(= x 5)"
- Logic: "(and (>= x 0) (<= x 10))", "(or A B)"
- Relations: "(+ x y)", "(- x y)", "(* x 2)"

**Error Handling:**
- Bad example: {"error": "Invalid JSON"} ❌
- Good example: {"error": "Variable 'x' declared twice. Each variable must have a unique name."} ✅
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Clear format examples
- ✅ Common patterns shown
- ✅ Good vs bad error examples
- ✅ Specific output schema

### 2. Enhanced Socratic Inquiry Prompt

**Before:**

```
Generate a Socratic questioning tree.
Topic: ${topic}
Deliberation steps:
1. For each layer from 1 to ${layers}, list probing questions
```

**After:**

```
You are a Socratic inquiry facilitator. Your goal is to generate probing questions that expose assumptions, clarify scope, and identify knowledge gaps.

**Purpose of Each Layer:**
- Layer 1: Clarify definitions, scope, and success criteria
  Example: "What exactly do we mean by 'success'?" "Who are the stakeholders?"
- Layer 2: Question assumptions and expose hidden constraints
  Example: "What are we assuming about the context?"
- Layer 3+: Challenge evidence, test boundaries, explore alternatives
  Example: "What evidence would prove/disprove this?"

**Identify Assumptions:**
Example: "We're assuming stakeholders agree on priorities" ✅
Not: "There are assumptions" ❌
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Clear layer purposes with examples
- ✅ Good vs bad output examples
- ✅ Actionable guidance (not generic)
- ✅ Specific, not vague

### 3. Improved Error Messages

**Before:**

```typescript
throw new Error("model_json is not valid JSON");
```

**After:**

```typescript
throw new Error(
  `Invalid JSON format. ${error.message}. ` +
  `Expected format: {"variables": [{"name": "x", "type": "Int"}], "constraints": ["(>= x 0)"]}`
);

throw new Error(
  `Validation error at '${path}': ${zodError.message}. ` +
  `Check that variables have 'name' and 'type' fields, and constraints are strings.`
);

throw new Error(
  `Duplicate variable name '${v.name}'. Each variable must have a unique name. ` +
  `Current variables: ${result.variables.map(v => v.name).join(', ')}`
);
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Specific error location
